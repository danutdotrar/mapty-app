# mapty-app

I learned more about JavaScript OOP, external libraries and geolocation API.

In this app you can log your workouts (cycling and running) and save the location of them, and details such as speed or duration.
Simply choose a point from the map and a new form will be opened, there you can complete the workout stats and hit enter to save them in local storage.

This project was an assignment from a course, only the JS part being my contribution.
